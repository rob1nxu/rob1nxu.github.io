                    <p>
                        </br>
                        We popped by Affogato Cafe the other day for a late lunch.</br>
                        </br>

                        The cafe had a pretty nice ambience and seemed like a good place to get a coffee and do some work from on a weekday. When
                        we arrived, the cafe was generally quiet, only about 2-3 tables were occupied.</br>
                        </br>

                        </br>They have hand rolled bagels which got us really excited!</br>
                        </br>

                        We ordered the breakfast bagel and the smoked salmon bagel. The food here is pretty pricy- the breakfast bagel was about
                        $12 and the smoked salmon bagel was about $16. On top of that we ordered 2 coffees! You can choose
                        the type of bagel that you would want to go with your chosen fillings, both the husband and I being
                        sesame lovers, both of us chose the sesame bagel. Hurhur.</br>
                        </br>
                    </p>
                    <img class="responsive-img" src="afg2.jpg">
                    <p>
                        </br>This was half of the breakfast bagel. Do not be misled by itâ€™s size, it may look small but its surprising
                        filling (even for the husband). The ingredients are pretty standard but the sauce was really good
                        and the whole thing went really well together. I would recommend having this bagel over the other
                        one I ordered which is theâ€¦.</br>

                    <p>
                        </br>Smoked Salmon Bagel! Sorry for the blurry picture I was kinda hungry. This bagel when I had the first
                        bite was soooo good but I think because the filling was cheese, after a while, it became a bit overwhelming.
                        The smoked salmon was really good but this bagel was a bit to rich for me so I would recommend the
                        Breakfast Bagel over this!</br>
                        </br>

                        Thereâ€™s one thing though. Service wasnâ€™t really great as the food took quite a while to arrive and they forgot our coffee
                        ðŸ˜¦ Coffee was pretty average, it was decent but not something I would recommend friends to travel
                        down for.</br>
                        </br>

                        Overall, I might pay the cafe another visit if I am in the vicinity but I probably would not travel down specifically to
                        dine there.</br>
